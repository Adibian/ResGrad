# ResGrad - PyTorch Implementation

This is an unofficial PyTorch implementation of [**ResGrad**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14518) as a high-quality speech synthesis model.

In short, this model generates the spectrogram using FastSpeech2 and then removes the noise in the spectrogram using the Diffusion method to synthesize high-quality speeches.
As mentioned in the paper the implementation is based on FastSpeech2 and Grad-TTS. Also, the HiFiGAN model is used to generate waveforms from synthesized spectrograms.
