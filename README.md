## ResGrad - PyTorch Implementation
[**ResGrad: Residual Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Text to Speech**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14518)

This is an unofficial PyTorch implementation of ResGrad as a high-quality speech synthesis model. In short, this model generates the spectrogram using FastSpeech2 and then removes the noise in the spectrogram using the Diffusion method to synthesize high-quality speeches. As mentioned in the paper the implementation is based on FastSpeech2 and Grad-TTS. Also, the HiFiGAN model is used to generate waveforms from synthesized spectrograms.
We trained ResGrad in single and multi-speaker datasets in Persian and English and tried to find the best parameters for any of them.
